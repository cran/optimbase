Description: Provides a set of commands to manage an abstract
        optimization method. The goal is to provide a building block
        for a large class of specialized optimization methods. This
        package manages: the number of variables, the minimum and
        maximum bounds, the number of non linear inequality
        constraints, the cost function, the logging system, various
        termination criteria, etc...
