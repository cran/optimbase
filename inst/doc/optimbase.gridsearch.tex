\keyword{method}{optimbase.gridsearch}
%
\begin{Description}\relax
Evaluate a constrained or unconstrained cost function on a grid of points 
around a given initial point estimate.
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
  optimbase.gridsearch(fun = NULL, x0 = NULL, xmin = NULL, 
                       xmax = NULL, npts = 3, alpha = 10)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{fun}] A constrained or unconstrained cost function defined as described 
in the vignette (\code{vignette('optimbase',package='optimbase')}).
\item[\code{x0}] The initial point estimate, provided as a numeric vector.
\item[\code{xmin}] Optional: a vector of lower bounds.
\item[\code{xmax}] Optional: a vector of upper bounds.
\item[\code{npts}] A integer scalar greater than 2, indicating the number of 
evaluation points will be used on each dimension to build the search grid.
\item[\code{alpha}] A vector of positive numbers, which give the factor(s) used to 
calculate the evaluation range of each dimension of the search grid (see 
Details). If \code{alpha} length is lower than that of \code{x0}, elements 
of \code{alpha} are recycled. If its length is higher than that of 
\code{x0}, \code{alpha} is truncated.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
\code{optimbase.gridsearch} evaluates the cost function at each point 
of a grid of \code{npts\textasciicircum{}length(x0)} points. If lower (\code{xmin}) and upper 
(\code{xmax}) bounds are provided, the range of evaluation points is limited 
by those bounds and \code{alpha} is not used. Otherwise, the range of 
evaluation points is defined as \code{[x0/alpha,x0*alpha]}.

\code{optimbase.gridsearch} also determines if the cost function is
feasible at each evaluation point by calling \code{optimbase.isfeasible}.
\end{Details}
%
\begin{Value}
Return a data.frame with the coordinates of the evaluation point, the value of
the cost function and its feasibility. The data.frame is ordered by 
feasibility and increasing value of the cost function.
