  * added optimbase.gridsearch function
  * optimbase.function: modified tests for T_FMINSEARCH into tests for T-FARGS
    because passing argument to a cost function should not have been restricted
    to the specific fminsearch algorithm
  * optimbase.outputcmd: modified test for T_FMINSEARCH into test for T-FARGS

  * optimbase.checkcostfun: corrected bugs in the calls to optimbase.function
    (wrong arguments were set up)
  * optimbase.isinnonlincons: corrected the f, g, c and gc assignments to use
    tmp instead of this.
