  * Corrected encoding of vignette source (latin1 instead of utf8x)
  
2011/03/16 Sebastien Bihorel <sb.pmlab@gmail.com>
  
  * optimbase.gridsearch: restricted grid expansion to avoid over user of
  memory.

2011/01/09 Sebastien Bihorel <sb.pmlab@gmail.com>
  
  * optimbase.gridsearch: corrected bug with alpha. Must contain values greater
  than 1.
  * vignette: correction of a typo in the description of the optimization
  problem section 1.1: gi(x) must be greater or equal to 0, and not lower or 
  equal to 0.

  * added optimbase.gridsearch function
  * optimbase.function: modified tests for T_FMINSEARCH into tests for T-FARGS
    because passing argument to a cost function should not have been restricted
    to the specific fminsearch algorithm
  * optimbase.outputcmd: modified test for T_FMINSEARCH into test for T-FARGS 

2010/05/18 Sebastien Bihorel <sb.pmlab@gmail.com>

  * optimbase.checkcostfun: corrected bugs in the calls to optimbase.function
    (wrong arguments were set up)
  * optimbase.isinnonlincons: corrected the f, g, c and gc assignments to use
    tmp instead of this.

  * DESCRIPTION: added dependency to the Matrix package (needed for the norm()
    function)
